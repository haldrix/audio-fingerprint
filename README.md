# audio-fingerprint
takes a 15 second audio sample and is able to identify it... ALMOST DONE!!!!. DONT PEEK TILL ITS DONE...IM OUT OF FREE PRIVATE REPOS....WILL CLEAN UP CODE SOON, ITS REAL BAD RIGHT NOW CUZ TABS INCONSISTENT. 



note: if you really want to run it: npm start

if that breaks for some reason, typical webpack commands for the dev server
